There are three csv in this repo. They are compressed in a zip.

You may only need two: 
  - colls_10ms_adjusted
  - 50ms_df
 
Both of them contain clean data. The 10ms bins csv contains the eye-tracking data adjusted around the onset of the target word. The 50ms_df was created to observe the time course evolution of gaze fixations on the target word. For the models, I guess we'll be using the 10ms csv. For the time course analysis, the 50ms csv.

The third csv (10ms clean) is the data frame from which the data was adjusted. It is also clean, but trials are still not comparable.
